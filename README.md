Project Overview
This project, CalcInterest, calculates the interest on home and property loans based on user inputs including loan type, loan amount, and loan duration (in years). The interest rate applied varies depending on the type and amount of the loan.

Chosen Modules
Main Module:

CalcInterest.java: This module contains the main functionality for computing the interest based on user input. It supports both home and property loans, applying different interest rates based on the loan type and amount.
Features:
Computes loan interest for both home and property loans.
Handles invalid inputs (e.g., negative loan amounts, unrealistic loan durations).
Uses precise calculations with proper rounding for accurate financial results.
Testing Module:

TestCalcInterest.java: This module is responsible for running unit tests against the CalcInterest class. It includes various test cases covering both valid and invalid inputs, ensuring that the main module functions correctly.
JUnit Tests: Integrated with JUnit 5, this module automates the testing process, running multiple test cases and logging results, ensuring the reliability of the CalcInterest class.
Additional Files:

Defect Tracker: Tracks any issues or discrepancies found during testing.
Unit Test Plan: Documents the test cases used to verify the functionality of the application.
